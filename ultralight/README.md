This folder contains tools I used to create Ape Naps.

in assets/images are all the .png files I drew.
in pack.js is the image compression script.
in looper.js i can set files to view in a loop before compressing them. 

In Ape Naps, the compressed versions can be found inside js/Images/imageDump.js
